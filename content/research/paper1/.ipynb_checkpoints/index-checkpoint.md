##### Abstract

Labor market mismatch is traditionally difficult to analyze because the complex relationships between categorical variables such as industry, occupation, and major. We propose a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assess mismatch. Our approach tasks LLMs with simulating a human resources specialist's role in evaluating the fit between an applicant and a job. Our study consists of two parts. First, we validate the GPT approach with an administrative dataset from an online job platform and show that our new measure of match quality correlates positively with traditional measures and can reveal additional insights. We also demonstrate the method's applicability with survey data, where traditional measures are infeasible because of the limited sample size. In the second part, we demonstrate two applications of GPT: one reproduces known knowledge, while the other provides new insights. The first application simulates an audit study to examine how gender disclosure influences LLM assessments, finding that gendered information leads LLMs to favor women for traditional female roles. The second application shows that how GPT contributes to understanding the versatility of majors. We show that majors that can fit a broad range of occupations are unfairly penalized by traditional mismatch measures, and the GPT measure can mitigate this issue.
