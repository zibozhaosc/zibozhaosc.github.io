##### Abstract

This paper investigates how AI affects creative work by examining changes to the time-quality relationship. In an experiment comparing professionals working with and without AI assistance, we measured the quality of their creative outputs at 15-minute intervals. Our results reveal that AI not only raises the overall time-quality curve but also transforms its shape. Specifically, AI significantly accelerates quality improvements during the initial production stage; however, it subsequently reduces the rate of quality improvement, flattening the curve after the first 15 minutes. In response to this flattened curve, 30% of creators choose to produce lower-quality work that requires substantially less time. These findings suggest that the current GenAI-induced technological change is biased towards time-saving rather than quality-enhancing.
