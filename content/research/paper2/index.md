##### Abstract

The task of text-to-table receives widespread attention, yet its importance and difficulty are underestimated. Existing works use simple datasets similar to table-to-text tasks and employ methods that ignore domain structures. As a bridge between raw text and statistical analysis, the text-to-table task often deals with complex semi-structured texts that refer to specific domain topics in the real world with entities and events, especially from those of social sciences.

In this paper, we analyze the limitations of benchmark datasets and methods used in the text-to-table literature and redefine the text-to-table task to improve its compatibility with long text-processing tasks. Based on this redefinition, we propose a new dataset called **CPL** (Chinese Private Lending), which consists of judgments from China and is derived from a real-world legal academic project. 

We further propose TKGT (**T**ext-**KG**-**T**able), a two-stage domain-aware pipeline, which firstly generates domain knowledge graphs (KGs) classes semi-automatically from raw text with the mixed information extraction (Mixed-IE) method, then adopts the hybrid retrieval augmented generation (Hybrid-RAG) method to transform it to tables for downstream needs under the guidance of KGs classes. 

Experiment results show that TKGT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both traditional datasets and the CPL. Our data and main code are available at [https://github.com/jiangpw41/TKGT](https://github.com/jiangpw41/TKGT).
